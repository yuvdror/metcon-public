// GET /r/<code> — an affiliate link landing.
//
// Rewritten here from /r/:code by vercel.json. This is the first serverless function on
// this site; everything else is static.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do: attribute the visitor, or claim a one-time offer
// code. Both happen later, in the app, once an authenticated account is asking — see
// POST /api/referral in the metcon repo. Attributing at click time would credit bots and
// link previews, and claiming a code at click time would drain a pool bought in batches
// from App Store Connect. A crawler that hits this URL costs us one lookup and nothing
// else.
//
// So all this does is: check the code names a real, approved affiliate, remember it in a
// cookie, and send the visitor to the App Store. The member's reward — 30 free days on
// the paid tier — is granted by POST /api/referral once an account exists to grant it to,
// which is why this page promises it but does not issue it.
//
// Env (set in the Vercel project, not here):
//   SUPABASE_URL                 https://hgpzwxsynzorhlpjliow.supabase.co
//   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY    server-side only; `affiliates` has no anon read policy
//   APP_STORE_URL                where to send someone without the app
